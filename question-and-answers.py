#If name is less than 3 characters long
      #name must be at least 3 characters

#Lets write a code for a game that will guess a secret number.
#we want players to guess only 3 times, not more than 3

#Ex4 
#we're building a car game that ..

#when you type help it prints a list of botton
   #start - to start the car
   #stop - to stop the car
   #quit - to exit 

#when you type anything else 
    # i don't understand that ...
#when you type start 
    #Car started ... Ready to go!
#when you type stop
    #Car stopped.
#when you type quit the whole program quits.


#Ex4a. #EX.. MAKE THE CODE BETTER.. in the above code, when you press stop or start twice it will print car 
#stoppedor start twice lets elevate the code to say car ready started or stopped if you press it more than 
#once


#EX5 #password simulation.. say you want a user to only try to log in with
#wrong password 4 times

# while True:    #we can also say while command != "quit"
#     command = input("> ").lower()     #we add .lower()to whatever answer to make whatever input they put to lower case. we could use command.lower() too
#     if command == "help":
#         print("""
# start - to start the car  
# stop - to stop the car
# quit or q - to exit 
#               """)
#     elif command == "start":
#         print("Car started ... Ready to go!")
#     elif command == "stop":
#         print("Car stopped.")
#     elif command == "quit" or command == "q":
#         break    
#     else:
#         print("i don't understand that ...")
