#in python we have lots of built in functions for performing mathematical operations
x = 2.9

#whenever you want to write a program that involves complex mathematical calculation, you will 
#need to import the math module. A module in python is a seperate file with some re-useable code.
#like...
import math
print(math.ceil(2.8))
print(math.floor(4.7))

#The math module has lots of functions built in it, google python3 math function to see them.
